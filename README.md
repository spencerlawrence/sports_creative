HTML/CSS/Javascript Creative Assignment for CS 260
Welcome to your first Creative Assignment! This will likely be unlike anything you've done in a CS class, but roll with it and have fun!

For this assignment, you should utilize your knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS (you must utilize all 3). Find something fun and create a new web page and prepare to present the page in class. You'll have a couple minutes (each) to present to a few other groups, and the top 5 in your class will present to the entire class. Make sure that your page doesn't require you to be there to explain it - because the TAs will be grading them without you there!

Do not copy another existing page! This is your chance to be creative and to work with another class member to do something phenomenal. If your project is simply an extension of a lab or a previous creative project, you will lose points.

The groups for this are here: Creative #1 Groups

** This assignment (and all creative projects) cannot be turned in late and need to be presented in class.**

You must submit to canvas the URL to your webpage (and make sure it is available from the due time until you have a grade), the URL to your github repository for this project, and a brief description about your creative usage of the technology(ies) required. This could include things you learned, issues you ran into (and overcame), or anything else you want to tell the TAs about your project. Make sure that your submitted URLs turn into links!

You must also put your project URL on the spreadsheet for class demo day:

Use this spreadsheet (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. for Section #1
Use this spreadsheet (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. for Section #2
You will be graded based off a combination of the following factors:

Your project is within the scope of the project
How well followed the above instructions were
a TA evaluation of your project
a small number of in-class peer evaluations (evaluations outside the in-class period will be discarded unless you talk to the TA)
